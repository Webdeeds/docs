## Authentication

The Webdeeds API is intentionally open as such it does not require authentication for access.

## Rate limiting

The Webdeeds API rate limits to ensure fair usage for all clients. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. For higher rate limits, please [contact support](mailto:hi@webdeeds.org).
