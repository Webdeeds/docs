## What is a webdeed? 

A webdeed is a unique, transferable identifier for a digital "thing". They are designed to be transfered in plaintext.

A webdeed could represent anything really: a movie ticket, subway tokens, potions or gold in a videogame. 

Here is a webdeed:
```
+10.deed_vruyd74k6m4u5tmyn5aewvpmzwm.VnOgntQ0AJFdn0LXmxvwMuMV97VBjt4
```

It's anatomy:

```
├─ Amount: +10
├─ ID: deed_vruyd74k6m4u5tmyn5aewvpmzwm
└─ Secret: VnOgntQ0AJFdn0LXmxvwMuMV97VBjt4
```

Owning this deed reads: 
"I have **10** units of something represented by ID **deed_vruy...** claimable by secret **VnOgntQ0...**"

They are called "webdeeds" because they can convey ownership and are native to the web.

### Claiming a webdeed

You may receive a webdeed... 
- from a friend over email, Discord, or iMessage 
- via scanning a QR code
- by copying the value directly from a website or app
- ...or a million other ways

Regardless of how you obtain a webdeed it is not "yours" until imported into your webdeed [wallet.](/wallet)

<Note>
Importing a webdeed into a wallet completes the transfer, ensuring that whoever gave or spent the deed is no longer able to give it to someone else.
</Note>


### Splitting a webdeed

The webdeed above, starting `+10.deed_vruyd...`, can be split into any multiple of **10** by a [wallet.](/wallet)
- **10** `+1.deed_vruyd...` deeds
- **2** `+5.deed_vruyd...` deeds
- **1** `+3.deed_vruyd...` and **1** `+7.deed_vruyd...`
- ...you get the idea.


Webdeeds with the same ID `deed_vruyd...` can be recombined to equal their sum. Splitting, recombining, or importing deeds destroys the old deeds, rendering them unspendable.

Your wallet can split a webdeed if you choose to send only a portion of your total balance, like making change from a $100 bill.

<Note>
It's the wallets resposibility to manage & organize deeds on your behalf. You can't split deeds outside of a wallet.
