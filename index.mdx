## Not a Blockchain or Cryptocurrency

Instead of minting tokens on a blockchain, Webdeeds lets you mint, split, transfer, and prove ownership of digital items via an open **centralized** API and **secret swapping** mechanism. Assets can be tickets, certificates, collectibles, anything you want to track and move around.

### Why a centralized ledger?

In _almost_ all cases A digital asset has value only when some operator agrees to redeem it for behavior in the world. A cosmetic skin in a video game is only valuable because the game designers fulfill an implicit covenant; the "owner" of the skin can change their avatar's appearance in-game. Whether asset "ownership" is tracked on a peer to peer ledger or a centralized database has no effect on the game designer's ability or desire to fulfill their side of the bargain. For these kinds of assets blockchains are security theater!

Webdeeds is designed with full acknowledgement of this reality and seeks to gain trust through long term, grass roots community building in hopes of one day becoming an open public utility on the internet.
